# flappyBird4School
Small game for a school project  
It's a personal version of Flappy Bird writte in processing. The bird is controlled by a Joystick connected to the Arduino which send X coordinates to the serial port. Processing takes those X's value and moves the character.

1. Plug in Arduino with a joystick or anything else wich produces an analog input and connect it to A2 pin on Arduino
2. Run JoystickController.ino on Arduino Ide
3. Run main.pde
4. Have Fun!


Maybe you should change COM3 to COM4 or COM2 or whatever in the processing file.
